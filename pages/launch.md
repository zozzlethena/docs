## Bridging

New Arbitrum users who want to participate in Velocimeter should make sure they
have `$ETH` on Arbitrum in order to be able to pay for transaction/gas fees.

Bridging to Arbitrum is possible here: [Arbitrum Bridge](https://app.Arbitrum.io/bridge). 
You can also bridge via [Multichain](https://app.multichain.org/#/router) or [Bungee](https://www.bungee.exchange/)

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  Some bridging services can take up to 20-30 minutes to complete a transfer of
  the assets. Velocimeter doesn't guarantee the results of any of the bridges. Issue with bridges 
  are best taken up with the respective communities of those bridges.

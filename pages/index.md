## Where does this project come from?
Velocimeter is a project built based on the original designs of [Andre Cronje's Solidly](https://andrecronje.medium.com/ve-3-3-44466eaa088b) which was later revised and made wildly successful by [Velodrome Finance](https://app.velodrome.finance/). 

## WTF is a velocimeter?
[Velocimetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocimetry) is the measurement of the velocity of fluids. A velocimeter is a tool that is used to measure fluid dynamics. We felt this is analogous to what is happening in our AMM & gauges; "Liquidity" is added, moved around, and "flows" in and out of it.
